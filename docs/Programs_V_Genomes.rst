Programs Vs. Genomes
********************

Pysh GP output programs in the push language. These programs can be executed by the Push interpreter included with Pysh. To evolve these programs, Pysh represents programs as Plush Genomes. These genomes, unlike push programs, are linear and thus easy to manipulate with genetic operators.

All information about Push programs and Plush Genomes can be found on `this page of the Push Redux <https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/pages/programs_and_genomes/index.html>`_.
