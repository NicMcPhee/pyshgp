********************************
Automatic Program Simplification
********************************

As of October 2016, I will not be publicly describing Pysh's automatic program simplification, because it is still in development, and the creators of the method are still researching (and possibly intending to pursue publication). In the interest of protecting their hard work, you can see Pysh's proto-type of simplification in the source code.

If you want an explaination of how this works, bug me on the `Pysh GitHub <https://github.com/erp12/Pysh>`_! Maybe open an `issue <https://github.com/erp12/Pysh/issues>`_ about it. Thanks :)
