The Push Language
=================

The following paragraph has been taken from the Push language `homepage <http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html>`_.

	Push is a programming language designed for evolutionary computation, to be used as the programming language within which evolving programs are expressed. Push features a stack-based execution architecture in which there is a separate stack for each data type. In Push, "code" itself is a data type, allowing programs to manipulate their own code as they run and thereby to implement arbitrary and potentially novel control structures. This expressiveness is combined with syntactic minimality: the only syntax rule is that parentheses must be balanced. It is therefore trivial to generate and transform syntactically valid Push programs.

An introduction to PushGP and all of its common features (most of wich are supported by Pysh) see the `"Introduction To Push" page of the Push Redux <https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/pages/intro_to_push/index.html>`_.
