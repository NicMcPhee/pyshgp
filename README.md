# Pysh2
Push Genetic Programming in Python.

## Push Genetic Programming
Push is programming language that plays nice with evolutionay computing / genetic programming. It is a stack-based language that features 1 stack per data type, including code. Programs are represented by lists of instructions, which modify the values on the stacks. Instuctions are executed in order.

More information about PushGP can be found here: http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html

For the most cutting edge PushGP framework, see the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) implementaion called [Clojush](https://github.com/lspector/Clojush).

## How to Use Pysh 2
Unlike the first implementation of [Pysh](https://github.com/erp12/PyshGP), Pysh2 is intended to be integrated with [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap). 

More demonstrations of this coming soon.
